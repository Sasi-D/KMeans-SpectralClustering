# KMeans-SpectralClustering
This project performs clustering analysis on a 2D dataset, applying Custom-K-means and Custom-spectral clustering algorithms(both implemented from scratch). It includes visualizations of cluster formations, error functions, and Voronoi regions, with a focus on exploring clustering techniques in two-dimensional space (RÂ²)
